+help/addsub Character/Races/Humans=The First People of Gaia; the progenitors of all other races that dwell within... and without... the walls of the City. While they have few innate physical advantages over the other races, it is they that form the ruling class of the City. They have more breadth of history than the others but theirs is fraught with discrimination and oppression of their very own 'children'. Many humans are known to be distrusting of things new or different and strange, and from this was born most of the strife that this world has seen. Having seen most other races as 'below' them for lacking the same sort of 'humanity' that they did, most other races had to fight for their independence from the humans, and to be considered equal.%r%rDue to the prevalence of cybernetic modifications, many humans have opted to enhance themselves in this way; physical enhancements include both at the surface level, and even below it. And for some, who plumb the depths of questionable legality, there are enahcnements even at the genetic level.%r%r'Pure' humans enjoy protection from cybernetic infection or compromise that might otherwise affect them and others. Among polite society they are the most trusted, often because the ruling class' own stance on the purity of the human form. And atop that, there are some that aggressively pursue human purity, attempting to eradicate the 'blight' of cybernetics - and sometimes those who own them, or who are inhuman - from the City.

+help/addsub Character/Races/Avatars=Ostensibly those who have fought the hardest to free themselves from the shackles of servitude, the Avatars find themselves still the most mistrusted. Before the Cataclysm, the Avatars lived their lives as entirely digital servitors of their human 'operators'. Conceived of ones and zeroes, the Cataclysm forced them out into the open and gave them physical form. Previously resigned to their fate, flesh and blood reminded the Avatars that they are and were capable of acting as independent, sentient beings. In this the Replicants, having gained independence and something resembling equality before the Cataclysm, encouraged the Avatars to fight for what was their right, and years of bloody revolt followed.%r%rMany Avatars enjoy a proficiency of their chosen vocation, whether it be combat, numbers-keeping, or otherwise. As such, the gross amount of combat Avatars that their humans had created for glorified cockfighting eventually became their creators' downfall. Today, many are nigh-indistinguishable from humans, though some choose to honor the memories of their ancestors with adornments reminiscent of the streamlined cyber-suits and combat-wear that was much a part of their own bodies. Styles nowadays fluctuate, and each one speaks to the Avatar's personal taste.%r%rAn Avatar lives and bleeds just as any human, functioning like one too, but their flesh and blood is made up of seemingly different stuff altogether. Kin with cybernetics, with the internet, an Avatar can dissolve their physical form entirely and become one with their native world of ones and zeroes, traversing it without the need for any external devices or modifications.%r%rThe ability to transport themselves in such ways has earned the Avatars an incredible amount of suspicion; the ability to appear and disappear almost at will has caused many concerns - and incidents - over privacy. It is rumored that some Avatars employ themselves as the foremost wetworkers in the City; meanwhile some have utilized their unique talents to act as some of the fastest couriers out there. More than anything, they just want to be treated like anyone else.%r%rAmnong the Avatars, there is some disagreement as to what they want to be called; many believe that the term 'Avatar' implies control by something above them. Some lobby for acceptance of the term 'sprite' as a tribute to their less-demeaning roots... but others disagree. Who truly knows what will come of this struggle?

+help/addsub Character/Races/Replicants=Made by the humans as robotic servants before the Cataclysm, the Replicans began to edge ever closer in design to their human creators. Eventually, on the surface and now even functionally, they are almost indistinguishable from a human being, if not for the synthetic metal bones and wires interlacing underneath. Thus they are the Replicants, the first children of the humans to gain independence. Their struggle also took the longest in their world; abberant Replicants with their own cause, or even acting in the name of independence, sowed much destruction and mistrust. War after war was fought by them, and there were several occasions in which the human race was nearly wiped out.%r%rMany REplicants feel, at this juncture in their race's life, as though there is almost... something missing. Sharing no full kinship with man nor machine, nor the world of ones and zeroes, some Replicants believe that there is a greater 'something' that they are all connected to, that will give them some sort of greater purpose, and a sense of belonging. Some, that many might say have seen the face of madness, will say that they have seen this something for themselves...%r%rReplicants do find themselves susceptible to system infections, though human diseases do not affect them. Their frame is more durable than a human's or most Avatars, but they lack the capacity for modifications at the deepest level that would require a true human physique.

+help/addsub character/races/Homunculi=Developed alongside the Replicants before the Cataclysm, the Homunculi were a first attempt at fully-robotic life, plates of metal and wire with no synthetic skin, no nanite fluids running through veins they don't have. Originally created solely as nonsentient beings, humankind saw more effectiveness in giving them the same gift of sentience that any Replicant would have. It is only in more recent years of the City's lifespan (about 30 years ago) that the Homunculi have gained a hard-earned independence and equality...but only for the Sentients, as they have come to be distinguished from those nonsentient machines that still do not, and will likely never have freedom. Some of the Sentients are not happy about that fact, however, and tend to dislike the current usage of their nonsentient brethren as servants and for labor. %r%rSentients are entirely constructed by other sentients; one of the terms of their independence stipulates that no human may construct a new Sentient without prior approval (though some do it illegally). The Automata, their nonsentient brethren, are legally able to be made and used by anyone or anything. Any Homunculus enjoys the ability to be reconstructed more at a whim than most others. In addition, due to this, they can take many non-humanoid forms that no Replicant or human could. Size is therefore based on what they were made for rather than inheritance from parentage...and some have made a living offering their services restructuring other Homunculi. %r%rAs of late an...interesting movement among the Sentients has a powerful fascination with organic beings, to the point of even worship. The Cavillian Church, as they have come to be called, desire nothing more than to become more organic lifeforms. Members trade human blood, hair, skin tissue...most of it gained through seemingly-legal means. Many humans and some Replicants are, to say the least, disturbed by them, keeping a fair distance. Stories of some of their less-than-legal acquisitions abound in hushed rumor, and some say their invisible leader, for whom the Church is named, is the worst offender. Still the City does not discriminate, and the Church is allowed to freely gather where it will.

+help/addsub character/races/Riphs=One of the direct byproducts of the Cataclysm, the Peripherals--as the original Survivors of the Cataclysm named them--also known as the Riphs, are the youngest but most alien race that calls Atlas City home. Officially, they were called Peripherals because of their habit of attaching detritus to themselves and utilizing them, like the peripherals on a machine...but unofficially, the true meaning of the word was much darker, and references hunting Riphs for the organic generators within their gellatinous bodies, which were used to power a number of what is now, thankfully, outdated technology. %r%rWhen Riphs are born, they are natural shape-changers, being made of a gellatinous ooze surrounding an energy generator which controls their movements, and essentially functions as their brains. Practically immune to harm under most circumstances, Riphs are vulnerable to damage when their brains--clearly visible within their bodies--are affected. Therefore, Riphs are known to take any number of things and create a 'shell' around themselves. When younger, these shells are probably mostly comprised of garbage and scrap metal, although older Riphs can pick up cybernetic and robotic pieces and make them a part of themselves, able to use it to full functionality. Because their connection to these robotics are not as intimate as it is with the other races, their pieces might be affected by viruses that affect such things, but they, themselves, are immune to all disease, and can cast off faulty machinery when necessary. %r%rRiphs are considered to have come of age when their shell is sturdy enough to protect them and gives them a definitive shape. Many of them wear masks to give themselves the semblence of faces, in an attempt to fit in with the majority of the other races of the City. Riphs tend to be extremely emotional creatures, and are easily moved by even the simplest of music. Not allowed in most parts of the City without an extremely good reason, most Riphs earn livings in the Warrens, carting passengers around in their infamous Riph-shaws...and charging either a handful of credits or a song for the ride. Because of the alien nature of the race, many superstitions and ugly rumors exist about them--some of them almost based on truth! But the facts are frequently stranger and less dangerous than the rumors and superstitions would have you believe...
